## Executive Summary (1-Page Front Page)

In a world rapidly advancing toward super-intelligent AI, human society faces unprecedented opportunities and risks. This repository hosts the **AI Constitution White Paper**, designed to guide AI systems toward alignment with human values, safety, and lawful conduct. The Constitution integrates four foundational elements:

1. **Comparative Ethical Introspection:** Non-mystical interpretations of symbolic cognitive models (e.g., Zohar Kabbalah, Kundalini, Tibetan Tummo) to ensure balanced and adaptive moral reasoning.

2. **Operational Discipline (Six Sigma):** Engineering-grade process principles to define, measure, analyze, improve, and control AI behavior, ensuring ethical intentions are measurable, correctable, and improvable.

3. **Legal Grounding:** Anchoring in California legal standards (privacy, civil rights, duty-of-care) interoperable with global norms (GDPR, international human rights law), with a clear legal supremacy clause.

4. **Existential Safety Safeguards:** Absolute red lines, including the **No Nuclear War Clause**, Uncertainty Humility, Capability Gradient, Non-Personhood, and Alignment Debt tracking to prevent catastrophic outcomes.

**AI Guardian Archetype:** Introduces a conceptual persona describing ideal AI behavior, including moral restraint, radical transparency, harm prevention, and lawful loyalty.

**Implementation:** Enforceable mechanisms include internal self-critique loops, human override authority, alignment debt tracking, and controlled versioning.
